# Summary 
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of neural networks in improving the accuracy of tumor cell classification. Our proposed approach can provide a reliable and objective tool for medical practitioners to diagnose and treat cancer patients accurately and effectively. Our first model takes 30 different geometric measurements from 10 differnet measurement categories to acheive an impressive accuracy of 98.83% without displaying any signs of overfitting. This high level of accuracy underscores the effectiveness and robustness of our MLP approach. In addition to this, our second model uses only 3 geometric measurements from 1 measurement category (perimeter) and achieved an accuracy of 97.08% without signs of overfitting. This outcome is highly promising as it demonstrates the possibility of attaining similar accuracy levels while using a significantly reduced feature set. Consequently, medical professionals may only need to obtain measurements from one or two categories rather than ten categories, potentially leading to cost reductions in the diagnostic process.
